Dependency
===================================

The deepCTR has the following requirements by default. We recommend users to use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com>`_, which is a popular Python data science platform with many common packages pre-installed.

- python 2.7
- scipy 
- numpy 
- scikit-learn 
- pandas
- tensorflow-gpu/tensorflow 1.4.0
- Keras 2.1.0

If you use Anaconda, then you only need to install `Keras <https://keras.io>`_ following the official installation guide.
