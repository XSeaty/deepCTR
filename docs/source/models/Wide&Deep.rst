Wide & Deep
===================================

The deep part of Wide & Deep is the same as FNN which embedding sparse feature 
into dense latent vector and apply DNN with concatenation of latent vectors as 
input. While the wide part of Wide & Deep aims to concatenate handcrafted 
feature with deep part's output implicit high-order feature.

Its network structure is shown below.
