PNN (Product-based Neural Network)
===================================

PNN embedding sparse feature into dense latent vector and apply DNN with 
concatenation of latent vectors and inner or outer product of latent vector as 
input to explicitly modeling low-order feature interactions and implicitly 
modeling high-order feature interactions.

Its network structure is shown below.
