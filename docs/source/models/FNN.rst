FNN (Factorization-supported Neural Network)
=============================================

FNN embedding sparse feature into dense latent vector and apply DNN with 
concatenation of latent vectors as input to implicitly and simultaneously 
modeling low-order and high-order feature interactions.

Its network structure is shown below.
