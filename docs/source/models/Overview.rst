Overview
===================================

Under the success of FM, there are many neural network models based on it, most
of which focus on:

  - adding the capability of modeling high-order feature interactions implicitly or explicitly
  
  - maintaining the ability of modeling low-order feature interactions implicitly or explicitly
  
It is general to apply Deep Neural Network (DNN) whose input should be designed
to capature the high-order feature interactions implicitly.
